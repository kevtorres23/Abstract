# Abstract

Abstract is a project that helped me to comprehend better the core concepts of React and Tailwind CSS. It consists of a web-based task management application, which allows you to create notes for pending tasks you may have, and organize them in three different sections: "To Do", "In Process", and "Done".

## Design in Figma
The UI design of the app can be found on the following links:
* [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/design/viqjM8d3XgNTjCm2jhahp1/Abstract?node-id=0-1&t=zna5Ehyq94rYkODB-1).
* [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/viqjM8d3XgNTjCm2jhahp1/Abstract?node-id=1-2&t=tDUsAGCnzeY2FSH1-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=57%3A185).

If you have any feedback, comments, or improvement suggestions on the UI design of the project that you would like to give me, I would appreciate it a lot! :)

## Development
I used React and Tailwind CSS to develop Abstract, as the initial purpose of this project was to help me understand the core concepts of these tools comprehensively.
